        <h3>About Us : </h3>
        Our food is characterized by Chinese and Indian cuisine, 
        but despite the country's gigantic neighbors, the food culture of Nepal 
        possesses its own unique expression with its distinctive spices and cooking
         methods. With us you can e.g. enjoy authentic Mo: mo (Nepalese dumplings), 
         unique curries and juicy pieces of meat from the grill.

        <p>In Frederiksberg is Restaurent Nepali Bhancha, which in 
          Danish means Nepalese Cuisine. December 2018 we start our 
          new department here in Frederiksberg, after a great success 
          of Tagensvej department where we have spoiled our guests with 
          tasty and well-prepared dishes from Nepal since 2015. Our food is 
          characterized by Chinese and Indian cuisine, but despite the country
           giant neighbors, then the food culture of Nepal possesses its own
            unique expression with its distinctive spices and cooking methods. 
            With us you can e.g. enjoy authentic Mo: mo (Nepalese dumplings), 
            unique curries and juicy pieces of meat from the grill. The atmosphere
             with us is pleasant and relaxed, and it is supported by our cozy decor 
             and always friendly staff. With us, we place great focus on ecology and
              therefore use as far as possible exclusively organic raw materials. 
              You can therefore suitably quench your thirst with an organic beer 
              (from NÃ¸rrebro Bryghus) or with a cup of organic tea or coffee. 
              Look past Nepali Bhancha and pamper the senses with an amazing taste 
              explosion from the small country in the mountains.
